# Zero-Shot-Object-Detection-with-grounding-dino
Grounding DINO is a zero-shot object detection model that can detect objects in images based on natural language prompts.  It works by first training a transformer-based object detection model on a large dataset of images and their corresponding bounding boxes. The model is then fine-tuned using a technique called grounded pre-trainin.Grounded pre-training involves feeding the model a sequence of images and their corresponding natural language descriptions. The model is then tasked with predicting the bounding boxes for the objects in the images, given the natural language descriptions. This process helps the model to learn to associate words and phrases with corresponding visual elements.
